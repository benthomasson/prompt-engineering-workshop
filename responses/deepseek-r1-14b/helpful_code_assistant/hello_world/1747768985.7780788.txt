Okay, so the user wants to write a "hello world" program in Python. I remember that in Python, printing text is straightforward. The simplest way is using the print function.

I should start by opening a new file or just writing it directly since it's short. The code would be 'print("Hello, World!")'. That should display "Hello, World!" when run.

Maybe I should mention saving the file with a .py extension and running it via the command line. But since the user just asked for the program, maybe that's unnecessary unless they need further guidance.

I think that's all. The code is concise and meets the requirement.

Here's a simple "Hello World" program in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This will print "Hello, World!" when you run it.
