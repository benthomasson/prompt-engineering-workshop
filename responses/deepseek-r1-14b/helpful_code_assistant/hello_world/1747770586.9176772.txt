Okay, the user wants me to write a hello world program in Python. That's pretty straightforward. I remember that in Python, you can print using the print function. So the simplest way is to use print("Hello, World!"). 

I should make sure the syntax is correct. The string should be in quotes, and the function call should have parentheses. Also, since it's Python 3, print returns a value by default, so there's no need for anything else.

Maybe I'll just write that one line of code. It's concise and does exactly what's needed.

To create a "Hello World" program in Python, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.

2. Write the following Python code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello_world.py`.

4. Run the program by either:
   - Opening a terminal and running: `python hello_world.py`
   - Using your IDE's run button

The program will output:

```
Hello, World!
```
