Okay, so I need to name some planets. Hmm, where do I start? Well, the first thing that comes to mind is Earth because we live here. But I think there are more planets in our solar system beyond just Earth. Let me think... There's Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Wait, wasn't Pluto considered a planet before? Oh right, it was but now it's classified as a dwarf planet. So maybe I should include that too, even though it's debated.

Let me list them out: Earth, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. That makes nine planets if you count Pluto. But sometimes people only mention the eight major ones because of the reclassification. Also, there are exoplanets beyond our solar system, but I think the question is about the planets in our solar system. So perhaps sticking to that is better.

Wait, did I miss any? Let's see: Mercury is closest to the Sun, then Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter (the gas giant), Saturn with its rings, Uranus and Neptune are the ice giants. Yeah, that seems comprehensive. Including Pluto might be helpful depending on what the user expects.

Pluto is often mentioned as well, though it is classified as a dwarf planet rather than a full-fledged planet.
