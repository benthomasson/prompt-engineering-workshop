Okay, the user asked me to name some planets. Let me see... Well, I know that there are eight planets in our solar system. I should list them out. So, starting from the Sun, it's Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Wait, Pluto used to be considered a planet, but I think it was reclassified as a dwarf planet now. Maybe I shouldn't include it unless the user specifically asks about dwarf planets.

I should make sure the names are clear and correct. Let me double-check each one: Mercury is closest, then Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter which is the largest, Saturn with rings, Uranus and Neptune which are ice giants. Yeah, that seems right. I'll present them in order from the Sun outward to keep it organized.

I wonder if the user wants just the main planets or if they're interested in others beyond our solar system. But since they didn't specify, I'll stick to the eight recognized ones. Maybe in case they want more, I can mention exoplanets exist too but aren't part of our solar system.

Here are some planets in our solar system:

1. Mercury
2. Venus
3. Earth
4. Mars
5. Jupiter
6. Saturn
7. Uranus
8. Neptune

These eight planets orbit the Sun, with Pluto historically considered a ninth planet but now classified as a dwarf planet. If you're interested in exoplanets (planets outside our solar system), there are many discovered so far, but they are not part of our solar system.
