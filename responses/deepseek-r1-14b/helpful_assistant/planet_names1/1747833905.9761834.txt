Okay, so I need to name some planets. Hmm, let's see... First off, I remember that in our solar system, the main planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto used to be considered a planet, but now it's classified as a dwarf planet, so maybe I should mention that as well.

Wait, the user just asked for some planets, not specifically in our solar system. Maybe they want examples from other star systems or exoplanets. But since most people are familiar with our own solar system first, perhaps I'll stick to those and then add a few exoplanet names if possible.

I think Kepler-452b is one of the more well-known exoplanets. It's often called "Earth's cousin" because it's similar in size to Earth and orbits its star in the habitable zone. Then there's Proxima Centauri b, which is interesting because it's the closest exoplanet to our solar system. It's orbiting Proxima Centauri, which is a red dwarf star right next door.

Oh, and HD 209458 b comes to mind too. I think that one was the first exoplanet where we detected its atmosphere. So it's a hot Jupiter, very close to its star, causing extreme temperatures. That could be another example.

I should probably list these in a clear way, maybe separate them into categories like our solar system planets and exoplanets for clarity. Also, I should keep the information concise since the user just asked for some names.

Wait, does the user want scientific names or common ones? Well, both would make sense, so including both would probably be helpful. Let me organize this properly.

Certainly! Here's a categorized list of planets:

**Our Solar System:**
1. Mercury
2. Venus
3. Earth
4. Mars
5. Jupiter
6. Saturn
7. Uranus
8. Neptune
9. Pluto (dwarf planet)

**Exoplanets:**
1. Kepler-452b ("Earth's cousin")
2. Proxima Centauri b (closest exoplanet to our solar system)
3. HD 209458 b (first exoplanet with detected atmosphere)

This list includes both the familiar planets in our own solar system and some notable exoplanets discovered beyond.
