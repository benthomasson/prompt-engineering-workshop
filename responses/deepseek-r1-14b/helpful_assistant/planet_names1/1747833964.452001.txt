Okay, so I need to list some planets. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know there's Earth, obviously, since we live here. Then there's Mercury, Venus, Mars... wait, what comes after that? Let me think.

I remember from school that the order goes Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, then the gas giants like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Oh right, Pluto was considered a planet when I was younger but now it's classified as a dwarf planet. So maybe I should include that too, just in case.

Wait, are there any other planets beyond those eight? Like, maybe some asteroids or something else? No, I think the main ones are the eight we usually talk about. Mercury is closest to the Sun, then Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Yeah, that sounds right.

I wonder if there are any other planets in our solar system that I'm missing. Let's see... No, I don't think so. Sometimes people get confused with things like Ceres or Eris, but those are dwarf planets too, not the main ones they usually list. So maybe it's safe to stick with the eight classical planets.

Also, sometimes people mention the outer planets as gas giants and the inner ones as rocky, but I don't think that affects the list itself just their classification. So in order from the Sun, it would be Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Yeah, that seems correct.

I guess another way to remember them is with a sentence: "My Very Eager Mother Just Sent Us Nine Pizzas." But now it's eight because Pluto isn't considered a planet anymore. Hmm, but maybe I should include it in the list just to be thorough? Or perhaps note that it's a dwarf planet.

Wait, does the user want me to mention only the main planets or include others like dwarf planets as well? The original response didn't include Pluto, so maybe it's better not to add it unless specified. But I'm not sure if the user expects it. Maybe I should check what is commonly accepted now.

I think in most educational contexts these days, they teach the eight-planet system, omitting Pluto as a dwarf planet. So perhaps listing the eight main ones is better. Let me make sure I get all eight names right: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Yep, that's eight planets.

I should probably write them in order from closest to farthest from the Sun to keep it organized. So starting with Mercury and ending with Neptune seems logical. That way, anyone reading the list can easily see their positions relative to each other.

Is there any chance I might have missed a planet? Hmm... Let's count: 1. Mercury, 2. Venus, 3. Earth, 4. Mars, 5. Jupiter, 6. Saturn, 7. Uranus, 8. Neptune. That's eight. No, I don't think any were skipped.

I could also mention the names of some moons or other celestial bodies, but I think the user specifically asked for planets, so it's better to stick with those. Unless they're looking for exoplanets as well, but that might be beyond what's needed here.

In summary, my list would include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. That covers the eight main planets in our solar system, ordered by their distance from the Sun. I think that should suffice for the user's request.

Here is a list of the eight main planets in our solar system, ordered by their distance from the Sun:

1. **Mercury**
2. **Venus**
3. **Earth**
4. **Mars**
5. **Jupiter**
6. **Saturn**
7. **Uranus**
8. **Neptune**

These are the planets that are commonly recognized in our solar system, excluding dwarf planets like Pluto.
