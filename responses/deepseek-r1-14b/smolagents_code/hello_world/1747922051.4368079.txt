Okay, I need to write a "Hello World" program in Python. That's pretty straightforward, right? So, first, I should think about what the task is asking. The user wants me to output the text "Hello World!" when the program runs.

In Python, printing something is done using the print() function. So I'll need to call that function with the string "Hello World!" inside it.

Wait, do I need any imports for such a simple program? No, because print is a built-in function in Python, so I don't have to import anything else. That makes things easier.

Let me structure this correctly. The code will be just one line: print("Hello World!"). Since the task doesn't specify any additional requirements or handling of user input, this single line should suffice.

I should also make sure that there are no syntax errors. Quotation marks around the string, correct use of parenthesesâ€”everything looks good here.

So putting it all together, I'll write a Python script that simply prints "Hello World!" when executed.

To solve this task, we need to write a simple Python program that outputs "Hello World!" when run. This is a fundamental programming problem often used as an introduction to any new programming language or environment.

### Approach
The approach to solving this problem is straightforward:
1. **Understand the Task**: The goal is to create a program that prints the string "Hello World!".
2. **Use Built-in Functions**: In Python, the `print()` function is used to output text. We will use this function to display our desired message.
3. **No Imports Needed**: Since we're only using the built-in `print()` function, there are no additional modules or imports required.

### Solution Code

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

### Explanation
1. **Using the print Function**: The `print()` function in Python outputs the specified argument to the standard output (usually the console). It is a fundamental function that every Python programmer uses frequently.
2. **Outputting the String**: By passing the string "Hello World!" as an argument to the `print()` function, we ensure that this message is displayed when the script runs.

This solution is efficient and meets the problem requirements with minimal code, making it ideal for beginners learning their first programming concepts.
