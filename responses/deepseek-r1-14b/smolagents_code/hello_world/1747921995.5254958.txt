Okay, I need to write a hello world program in Python. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I know that in Python, printing is done using the print() function. So I should use that.

The task is straightforward: just output "Hello, World!" on the console. There's no need for any complex code or additional libraries. 

I don't need to import anything because print is a built-in function. 

So the code will be simple: print("Hello, World!"). That's it. No variables or other steps required.

I should make sure that I follow the syntax correctly. The string should be in quotes, and the function call should have parentheses. 

No potential issues here since this is a basic command. Just execute the print statement as is.

To write a "Hello World" program in Python, we can use the built-in `print` function to output text.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Use the print() Function**: The `print()` function in Python outputs text or expressions to the console.
2. **Output "Hello, World!"**: By passing the string `"Hello, World!"` as an argument to `print()`, it will display that text.

This code is executed and produces the output:

```
Hello, World!
```
