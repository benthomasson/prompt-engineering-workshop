Okay, so I need to find out the weather in New York and then return that information using the final_answer tool. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that there's a specific tool called 'weather' which I can use. This tool probably provides current weather details when given a location. So, I should call this tool with "New York" as the argument.

Wait, but how do I structure the code for that? I think it's something like weather(location="New York"). That makes sense because I'm specifying where I want the weather information from.

Once I get the data back, I need to process it. The response might include various details like temperature, condition, humidity, etc. But since the user just asked for the weather, maybe I can return a summary that includes the most important aspects.

I should make sure to store the result of the weather tool in a variable so I can use it later. Let's call that variable 'weather_info'. Then, I'll format the information into a readable string that includes the temperature and condition.

Finally, I'll pass this formatted string to the final_answer tool so it's returned as the answer. I need to make sure I don't include any unnecessary variables or tools in this process.

Putting it all together: call the weather tool with New York, store the result, format it into a summary, and then return that summary using final_answer. That should complete the task.

To solve the task of finding the weather in New York and returning it, I will use the available tools to fetch the information and present it succinctly.

**Thought:**  
I need to call the `weather` tool with "New York" as the location argument to retrieve current weather details. Then, I will format this information into a readable summary and return it using the `final_answer` tool.

**Code:**
```python
# Fetch weather data for New York
weather_info = weather(location="New York")

# Extract relevant information and format the response
response = f"The current weather in New York is {weather_info['temperature']}Â°F with {weather_info['condition']}. humidity is {weather_info['humidity']}%, and wind speed is {weather_info['wind_speed']} mph."

# Return the formatted response as the final answer
final_answer(response)
```
