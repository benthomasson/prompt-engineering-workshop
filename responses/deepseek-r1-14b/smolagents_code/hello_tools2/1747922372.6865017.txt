Okay, I need to figure out how to use the weather tool to get the weather information for New York and then return it using the final_answer tool. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should identify which tools are available. From the user's message, I know there's a weather tool that can fetch weather data. The goal is to call this tool with "New York" as the location parameter.

I remember from previous examples that when using tools, each function call requires specific arguments. For instance, if the weather tool is named something like get_weather, it probably expects a city name or location as an argument. So I should structure my code accordingly.

Next, after fetching the weather data, I need to return it using the final_answer tool. That means I'll take the output from the weather function and pass it into final_answer.

I also need to make sure that I'm following all the rules provided. For example, I shouldn't chain too many tool calls in one block if their outputs are unpredictable. But since both weather lookup and returning a result are straightforward, I can do them in separate steps within the same code block.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Call the weather tool with "New York" as the argument.
2. Capture the returned weather information.
3. Use final_answer to return this information.

I should write the code accordingly, making sure that each function is called correctly without any syntax errors. I'll also ensure that variable names are appropriate and don't clash with any existing ones.

Wait, do I need to handle any exceptions or unexpected outputs? The examples provided didn't show error handling, so perhaps it's safe to assume the tools work as expected. Therefore, I can proceed without adding extra checks unless specified otherwise.

Putting it all together, my code will first fetch the weather for New York using the weather tool and then return that data with final_answer.

To solve this task, we need to retrieve the current weather information for New York City using a designated weather tool and then return this information. 

### Approach
1. **Identify the Tool**: We have access to a weather tool that can fetch weather data based on location.
2. **Retrieve Weather Data**: Use the weather tool with "New York" as the input parameter to get the current weather details.
3. **Return the Result**: Utilize the final_answer tool to present the retrieved weather information.

### Solution Code
```python
# Call the weather tool to get New York's weather
weather_info = weather(location="New York")

# Return the weather information using the final_answer tool
final_answer(weather_info)
```

### Explanation
1. **Calling the Weather Tool**: The `weather` function is invoked with "New York" as the argument, which fetches the current weather details for that location.
2. **Storing Results**: The retrieved weather data is stored in the variable `weather_info`.
3. **Returning the Result**: The `final_answer` tool is used to output the weather information, ensuring it is returned correctly as part of the solution.

This approach efficiently retrieves and returns the required weather information using the specified tools.
