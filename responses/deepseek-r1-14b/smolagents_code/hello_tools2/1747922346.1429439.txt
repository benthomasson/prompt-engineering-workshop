Okay, I need to figure out how to use the weather tool to get the weather in New York and then return it using the final_answer tool. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'm aware that there's a tool called `weather` available. I should check what parameters it requires. From the examples given earlier, tools are called with specific arguments like `query`, not as dictionaries. So, I'll need to call `weather(query="New York")`.

Next, after calling this tool, I'll get the weather information. But since the output format isn't predictable, it's safer to print the result so that I can see it clearly before proceeding.

Once I have the weather data, I'll use the `final_answer` tool to return it as the answer. It's important to ensure that I pass the correct variable to this tool, which in this case is the weather string obtained from the first step.

I should make sure not to chain these calls in one block because of potential formatting issues with the output. Instead, I'll execute each part separately: first get the weather, then print it, and finally return it using `final_answer`.

So, I'll write a code snippet that uses the `weather` tool with "New York" as the query, store the result in a variable, print it for verification, and then pass this variable to `final_answer`.

### Solution:
```python
# Get weather information for New York
weather_ny = weather(query="New York")

# Print the weather data for verification
print("Weather in New York:", weather_ny)

# Return the weather information as the final answer
final_answer(weather_ny)
```

```python
<no output>
```
