Alright, I need to figure out how to use the weather tool to look up the weather in New York and then return that information using the final_answer tool. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember from the examples provided that there's a tool called `weather` which can fetch weather data for specific locations. The tool probably takes parameters like location or city name. So, I should call this tool with "New York" as the argument.

Next, I'll need to store the result of this query in a variable so I can use it later. Let's say I assign it to `weather_ny`.

Once I have the weather data for New York, I need to pass this information to the `final_answer` tool so that it's returned as the output. I should make sure to format the argument correctly, using `query="text here"`.

I also need to be careful with how I structure my code. Each thought and code block should be separate, and I shouldn't chain too many tool calls in one block if the output is unpredictable.

Putting it all together, I'll write a code snippet that calls the weather tool for New York and then uses final_answer to return the result.

### Solution:

**Thought:**  
I need to use the `weather` tool to get the current weather information for New York. Then, I will store the result in a variable and pass it to the `final_answer` tool.

**Code:**
```python
# Get weather data for New York
weather_ny = weather(location="New York")

# Return the weather information with final_answer
final_answer(query=f"{weather_ny}")
```
