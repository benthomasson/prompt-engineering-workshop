Alright, I need to find out how to use the weather tool to get the weather for New York and then return it using the final_answer tool. 

First, I should figure out what tools are available. The user mentioned that they have access to specific tools, but in this case, it seems like there's a weather tool available. So, I'll assume there's a function called weather() that I can use.

I need to call this weather tool with the location "New York". So, the syntax would be something like weather(location="New York"). 

Once I get the weather data back, I should print it out so I can see what information is returned. This will help me understand how to format or extract the necessary details if needed.

Finally, I have to use the final_answer tool to return the weather information. So, I'll take whatever data I got from the weather function and pass it into final_answer().

Putting it all together, I'll write a code snippet that calls the weather function with "New York", prints the result, and then uses final_answer to return that weather data.

To solve this task, we will use the `weather` tool to fetch the current weather information for New York. After retrieving the data, we will store it in a variable and then use the `final_answer` tool to present the result.

Here are the steps:

1. **Call the Weather Tool**: Use the `weather` function with the location parameter set to "New York" to get the current weather details.
2. **Store the Result**: Save the returned weather information in a variable for further use.
3. **Return the Result**: Utilize the `final_answer` function to output the weather data as the final result.

```python
# Get weather info for New York
weather_result = weather(location="New York")

# Print the weather result for verification
print("Weather in New York:", weather_result)

# Return the weather information using final_answer
final_answer(weather_result)
```

**Output:**

The weather information for New York will be retrieved and printed, followed by the same data being returned as the final answer.
