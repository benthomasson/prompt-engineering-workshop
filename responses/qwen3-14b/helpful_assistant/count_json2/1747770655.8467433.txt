Okay, the user wants me to count from 1 to 10 as a JSON list. Let me check the examples they provided. The examples show JSON arrays like [1,2,3], [4,5,6], etc. So they want a list of numbers from 1 to 10 in a JSON array.

Wait, the user mentioned "Return your answer as a markdown formatted JSON". So I need to make sure the output is in JSON format, enclosed within triple backticks. The examples they gave are in markdown code blocks with json syntax highlighting. So the final answer should look like that.

Let me create the JSON array. The numbers should be from 1 to 10, each as a number in the list. So the array should be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Then wrap that in a code block with the json language specified. Let me double-check the formatting. The user's examples have three backticks, then the json, then another three backticks. So I need to do the same. Alright, that should be it.

```json
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```
