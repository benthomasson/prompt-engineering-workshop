Okay, the user wants me to count from 1 to 10 as a JSON list. Let me see. They also provided examples of markdown formatted JSON, like [1,2,3], [4,5,6], etc. So I need to make sure the output is in the correct format.

First, I should generate a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Let me check: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. That's ten numbers. Now, I need to put them into a JSON array. JSON lists are enclosed in square brackets, with each element separated by a comma. So the structure should be [1,2,3,...,10].

Wait, the user mentioned markdown formatted JSON. But in their examples, they just used the JSON inside code blocks. So maybe they just want the JSON array without any extra formatting. Let me confirm the examples again. The examples show code blocks with the JSON lists. So I should present the answer in a code block, like the examples.

Also, the user specified to return the answer as a markdown formatted JSON. So I need to ensure that the JSON is properly formatted, with commas between elements and correct brackets. No trailing commas, which could cause JSON parsing errors. Let me double-check the numbers: 1 to 10 in order. Yes, that's correct.

I think that's all. Just output the JSON list from 1 to 10 within a code block.

```json
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```
