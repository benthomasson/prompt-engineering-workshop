Okay, the user wants me to count from 1 to 10 as a JSON list. Let me see. They also provided examples of markdown formatted JSON, like [1,2,3] and so on. So I need to make sure the output is a JSON array with numbers 1 through 10 in order.

First, I'll start by creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Let me check: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. That's ten numbers. Now, I need to format this as a JSON array. JSON arrays are enclosed in square brackets, with each element separated by a comma. Each number should be a JSON number, not strings. So it should look like [1,2,3,...,10].

Wait, the user's examples have the numbers without quotes, which is correct for JSON. So I need to make sure that the output is a valid JSON array. Let me double-check the syntax. Yes, commas between elements, no trailing commas. The numbers are all integers, so no decimal points. Alright, that should be straightforward.

I should also ensure that the answer is in markdown format as specified. The user provided examples with triple backticks and the json language specifier. Wait, in their examples, they used ```json and then the list. But the actual output should be a JSON list. Wait, the examples they gave are actually just lists in markdown, but the user is asking for a JSON list. Wait, looking back at the user's message:

They said "Return your answer as a markdown formatted JSON like these examples" and then showed examples like [1,2,3] inside triple backticks. But those examples are not valid JSON. Wait, JSON requires that numbers be in a list with commas and brackets. But the examples they gave are just lists, not proper JSON. Hmm, maybe they made a mistake in the examples. But the user's instruction says to return as a JSON list. So perhaps they want a valid JSON array, even though their examples are not properly formatted.

Wait, looking at the examples again:

They have:

```json
[1,2,3]
```

But in JSON, that's actually a valid JSON array. Wait, no, in JSON, the array should be enclosed in square brackets. Wait, the example shows [1,2,3] inside a code block with json. So that is a valid JSON array. So the user wants the answer to be a JSON array, formatted in markdown with triple backticks and the json language.

So the correct answer would be a JSON array of numbers 1 through 10, enclosed in square brackets, separated by commas, and wrapped in a markdown code block with ```json.

So putting it all together, the answer should be:

```json
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```

I need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted. Let me check for any possible errors. The numbers are all integers, commas are correctly placed, no trailing commas. Yes, that looks correct. Alright, that's the answer.

```json
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
