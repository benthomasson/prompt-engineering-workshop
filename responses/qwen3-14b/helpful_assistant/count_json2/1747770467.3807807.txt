Okay, the user wants me to count from 1 to 10 as a JSON list. Let me see. They also provided examples of markdown formatted JSON, like [1,2,3], etc. So I need to make sure the output is a JSON array with numbers 1 through 10.

First, I should check if the examples are using JSON syntax correctly. The examples given are in markdown code blocks, which is correct. The user probably wants the answer in the same format. So the final answer should be a JSON list inside a code block.

Wait, the user said "Return your answer as a markdown formatted JSON like these examples". The examples they showed are just JSON arrays in code blocks. So I need to output the numbers 1 to 10 in a JSON array, enclosed in a code block with triple backticks.

Let me make sure the JSON is valid. The list should start with [ and end with ], each number separated by commas. No quotes around the numbers since they are numbers, not strings. So the correct JSON would be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

I need to put that inside a markdown code block. The examples they gave used three backticks, so I'll do the same. Let me double-check for any typos. Numbers from 1 to 10, commas between them, proper brackets. Yep, that looks right. Alright, that's the answer.

```json
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
